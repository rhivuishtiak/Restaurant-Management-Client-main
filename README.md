User-Friendly Interface:
 Users should be able to view the top-selling food items, access detailed food descriptions, explore various food categories, search for specific dishes by name, read blog posts about the restaurant, and reserve a table without the need for an account or login.

Menu and Food Details:
Provide a comprehensive menu section where users can browse and view detailed information about each food item, including its name, description, price, and any dietary information. 

Reservation System:
Implement a reservation system that enables users to reserve a table at the restaurant for their desired date and time. Collect necessary information such as the number of guests, special requests, and contact details to confirm and manage reservations effectively.

 Order Placement:
Offer user account creation and login functionality, allowing registered users to place food orders. Users should be able to add selected items to their cart, specify quantities, and complete the order process.

Food Management for Admin:
This panel should allow staff to update food details, add new dishes to the menu, and review the list of items they've added. It's important to have secure authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized personnel can make changes.
